# iter_recur

All iteration can be changed to recursion, and all recursion can be changed to iteration.

## Iteration to Recursion
Iteration can be changed to tail recursion, and tail recursion is recursion with recursion as the last step. Iteration condition becomes recursion base case, iteration body becomes recursion step, and iteration local variables become recursion parameters.
